# desafio-docker-cluster-dio

This projeact was created at Docker Fundamentals course on DIO.

I needed to create a local cluster with Docker Swarm and Vagrant to build VMs.

Vagrant creates the master and workers (nodes) VMs on VirtualBox, specified in Vagrantfile.

Then, Docker Swarm creates the cluster between these VMs.
